                <p>Hi, I am <b>Lawrenz Dan Manalastas Capili</b>. I am also at my 3rd year of college and currently taking the program of BSCpE in the University of the East - Manila
                Name of my father is Dan Torres Capili, my mother's name Juanita Manalastas Capili, and the name of my sister is Ashley Anne Manalastas Capili.
                My hobbies are playing basketball and hopefully, I can represent our to school to the UAAP and claim the title. Playing music is also my hobby, I can play guitar, drums and virtual drums.
                But we are in the middle of pandemic so I can't focus on playing Basketball. One of my favorite hobby is playing guitar, I can fingerstyle also the song Thousand Years and Paraluman by Adie.
                I was born on my hometown Candaba, Pampangga. Which why my dialect is kapampanggan. I can understand what my parents saying. But I can't talk fluently.
                I also born in October 10, 2000, my parents talk to me about it and I should be born on September 2000 but I got out on October hahahaha.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite international songs are: I Like me Better by Lauv, 13 by Lany and Wing$ by Maclemore. On the other hand in opm songs are: Your Song by Parokya Ni Edgar, Blue Skies by Hale and also Ikaw Pa Rin by Letter Day Story. 
                </p>
                <p> That's all, Thank you for reading!!!</p>
